<h3>Our Barbecue</h3>
<p class="c">At the Gambling Stick, we pride ourselves on using all local, seasonal, ingredients, including pasture-raised meat from Porter Road Butcher to make our Appalachian heritage inspired barbecue. Our meats are dry-rubbed and smoked with native Tennessee cherry until tender and juicy. No dry meat here. All sides are handmade in small batches using locally grown produce. 

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class="c">What is The Gambling Stick? Will it inevitably lose you your spouse, partner, sanity and/or respectability? The short answer is noâ€¦ unless you have addictive tendencies and a proclivity towards pork like the rest of us. The gambling stick is a old Appalachian name for a stick used to hang a pig from the limb of a tree or staked down sapling. The stick is riddled on both ends, threaded through the heels of the pig to supports its weight while being harvested. The gamble is whether or not the stick will support the weight of the pig, if not the whole thing could come crashing down on the butchers head. The Gambling Stick, unlike its namesake, won't have any risk involved. It is a tip of the hat to the men and women of Appalachia who made their living in the mountains and foothills of Tennessee. Like those before us, we want to utilize Tennessee's abundance and natural diversity to source and create food that is unique to Appalachia.</p>

<h4>Meat</h4>
<p class="g">We believe that great barbecue starts with great meat, and the best meat is that which is raised and processed locally with care. All of our meat is sourced through Porter Road Butcher Meat Company. Meat provided by Porter Road Butcher is local, pasture-raised, and antibiotic free with no added hormones.  All farms are regularly visited by the butcher shop owners to ensure that the animals, land, and employees are being treated with the care the deserve.</p>

<h4>Produce</h4>
<p class="e">Making fresh and seasonal sides means that we have to work with local farmers to find the produce that is in season and looking great.  The Gambling Stick get it's produce from Farmer Dave at Rock Bridge Trees.</p>
<h4>Bread</h4>
<p class="e">Great bread is the foundation for many of the items we serve at The Gambling Stick. Charpiers, a local Nashville bakery provides all of the rolls on which our sandwiches are served. </p>
